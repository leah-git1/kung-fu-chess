# Kung-Fu Chess

A real-time chess variant where both players move simultaneously — no turns, no waiting.
Built from scratch in Python with OpenCV rendering, a fully split microservice backend, WebSocket multiplayer, ELO matchmaking, and a Kubernetes-ready deployment.

## How It Works

- Both players move any piece at any time — there are no turns
- After a piece moves it enters a **cooldown** before it can move again
  - Regular move → **Long Rest** — gold overlay drains over the cell
  - Jump → **Short Rest** — purple overlay drains faster
- Capturing the enemy **King** ends the game
- Pieces animate through states: `idle → moving → long_rest → idle` or `idle → jumping → short_rest → idle`
- If a player disconnects, their opponent gets a 20-second grace countdown before the game is forfeited

## Architecture

The backend is a fully split microservice system designed to scale to **100M registered users** and **10M concurrent players**.

### Services

| Service | Responsibility | Port |
|---|---|---|
| **API Gateway** | Login, register — REST entry point for clients | 8080 |
| **WS Gateway** | WebSocket entry point — validates sessions, routes to shard | 5555 |
| **Auth Service** | Credential validation, user registration, session tokens | 8000 |
| **Rooms API** | Room creation and lookup (Redis-backed) | 8001 |
| **Rating Service** | ELO calculation and persistence at game end | 8002 |
| **Matchmaker** | ELO-based queue, pairs players, publishes `kfc.matched` to NATS | 8003 |
| **Game Allocator** | Consumes `kfc.matched`, picks least-loaded shard worker, publishes `kfc.allocated` | 8004 |
| **Game Server Shard** | Authoritative `GameSession` per room, multiprocess (one worker per CPU core) | 5556–55xx |
| **Redis** | Sessions, room→shard mapping, matchmaking queue, worker heartbeats | 6379 |
| **PostgreSQL** | Users, ELO ratings, durable storage | 5432 |
| **NATS** | Internal control-plane event bus (`kfc.matched`, `kfc.allocated`) | 4222 |

### Event Flow (Matchmaking)

```
Player clicks Play
  → WS Gateway enqueues in Matchmaker
  → Matchmaker pairs by ELO → publishes kfc.matched to NATS
  → Game Allocator picks least-loaded worker → writes Redis → publishes kfc.allocated
  → WS Gateway resolves Future → sends ShardConnectMsg to both clients
  → Clients reconnect directly to the assigned Game Shard worker
  → GameSession starts
```

### Game Server Multiprocessing

Each Game Server Shard container runs one worker process per CPU core. Every worker:
- Owns its own asyncio event loop and a shard of active rooms
- Heartbeats `shard:worker:{pid} → {host, port, rooms}` into Redis every 10 seconds
- The Game Allocator reads all heartbeat keys and always picks the worker with the fewest active rooms

## Running the Game

### Local (no network, no server needed)
```bash
cd logic
py graphics/app.py
```

### Docker Compose (full stack, single machine)
```bash
docker compose up --build
```
Then run the client:
```bash
cd client
py main.py --host localhost --port 5555 --api-port 8080
```

### Kubernetes (Docker Desktop)
Enable Kubernetes in Docker Desktop settings, then:
```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/postgres.yaml -f k8s/redis.yaml -f k8s/nats.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/auth-service.yaml -f k8s/rating-service.yaml -f k8s/rooms-api.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/matchmaker.yaml -f k8s/game-shard.yaml -f k8s/game-allocator.yaml
kubectl apply -f k8s/api-gateway.yaml -f k8s/ws-gateway.yaml
```
Then run the client:
```bash
cd client
py main.py --host localhost --port 30555 --api-port 30080
```

### Playing from Another Machine / Country
Deploy the Docker Compose stack to any cloud VM (AWS EC2, GCP, etc.):
1. SSH into the VM, clone the repo, run `docker compose up -d`
2. Open ports `8080`, `5555`, `5556`, `5557` in the firewall
3. Set `SHARD_PUBLIC_HOST=<VM_PUBLIC_IP>` in `docker-compose.yml`
4. Players connect with:
```bash
py main.py --host <VM_PUBLIC_IP> --port 5555 --api-port 8080
```
